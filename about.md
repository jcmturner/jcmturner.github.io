This blog shares information on my experiences, findings and thoughts in learning a variety of technologies.
I hope that posts published here will be of use to people.

They also serve some selfish purposes:
* Firstly they aid my learning: If you see anything in my posts you think is wrong, please let me know as this will help correct my understanding and I can also update to ensure any information I'm sharing doesn't misguide others.
* Secondly they help me compose my thinking: By writing these blogs I hope to ensure my understanding is complete and well organised. It also helps my mental recall of what I've learnt.
